# Churn-Prediction
Companies should be able to predict the behavior of customers correctly to reduce customer churn rate. Retaining existing customers is less expensive than acquiring new customers. Moreover, the revenue from repeat customers is usually higher than from new customers. In a competitive industry, where there is plenty of competitors, the cost for customer acquisition could be even higher. That is why predicting customer churn becomes so vital for businesses to be able to retain them before they decide to leave. 
 
The commonly used techniques to predict Customer Churns are neural networks, statistical-based techniques, decision trees, covering algorithms, regression analysis, kmeans, etc.  
 
So, with this proposed system, we've got a solution for the churn problem in the banking sector using Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forest.
